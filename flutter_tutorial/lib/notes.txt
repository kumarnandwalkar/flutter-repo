in flutter everything is a widget
there are 2 types of widgets
1. stateless widget: such widgets or things which changes which will
    not change on doing anything / these widget will not change its state
2. stateful widget: such widgets or things which will change their
    state on action / these widgets are used where we want that
    perticular widget to change its property
